I ran into a need to modify the resulting images outside of virt-builder when trying to install rvm.
Problems with:
 - sourcing the rvm login scripts
 - running configure on building ruby, problem with a bad file descriptor.

To work around this I tried to add rvm + ruby through normal vagrant setup then run
 vagrant package --output box_name

This almost worked...
Got a working virt image, but vagrant package removed the ssh keys causing ssh to not work.

To fix this I manually opened the image:
 tar xvfz image.box
 sudo guestmount -a ./box.img -i --rw /guest/
   make changes
 umount /guest

Ran into a problem with the ssh context
